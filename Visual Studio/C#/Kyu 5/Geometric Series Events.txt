# Geometric Series Events

https://www.codewars.com/kata/68379963cbaf46ff456c2899/csharp

Description:
A infinite sequence of events has the property that the number of days between successive events 
follows a geometric series with constant r, a positive integer. 
For example, if r = 2, this means that event 2 occurs 2 days after event 1, event 3 happens 4 days after event 2, 
event 4 follows 8 days after event 3, and so on. You know the day of the week of the first event, called start_day. 
Given any day in the week, called target_day, and a positive integer n, 
predict the number of the event in the sequence when the n'th occurrence of target_day occurs. 
Weekdays are indicated using "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa", "Su".

Example 1: find_nth_occurrence(start_day = "Mo", r = 2, n = 1, target_day = "Su") should return 3. 
Explanation: Which event is the first occurring on a Sunday? 
Since r = 2, and event 1 is on a Monday, we know that event 2, which occurs 2 days later, is on a Wednesday. 
So event 3, 4 days after event 2, is the first event on a Sunday.

Example 2: find_nth_occurrence("We", 3, 2, "We") should return 7, since we can find the second Wednesday as follows:

1,We 
-> 2,We+3 (since r=3) -> 2,Sa
-> 3,Sa+9 -> 3,Mo 
-> 4,Mo+27 -> 4,Su
-> 5,Su+81 -> 5,Th 
-> 6,Th+243 -> 6,Tu
-> 7,Tu+729 -> 7,We.
If fewer than n occurrences of target_day occur in the entire sequence, return -1.

Constraints: 1 ≤ r ≤ 106, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10100.
